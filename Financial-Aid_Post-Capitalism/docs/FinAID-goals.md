### The Why: What are we trying to do?

Imagine the world as a big classroom, and each country is like a student with different needs and abilities. Some students (countries) have lots of toys (resources) and are doing well, while others don't have many toys and need help.

The machine learning model is like a smart teacher who wants to find out which students (countries) need extra help, like more pencils, books, or toys. This help is called "foreign aid," and it can be used to build better schools, hospitals, and roads.

So, the model's goal is to look at all the students (countries) and figure out who needs the most help and what kind of help they need. It does this by looking at many things about each student, like how many toys they have, how healthy they are, and how well they are doing in school.

### The How: Is the Preprocessed World Data Useful?

Now, let's think about the preprocessed world data as a big, colorful chart with lots of information about each student (country). It tells us things like how many toys they have, how good they are at reading, and how healthy they are.

Before the smart teacher (model) can use this chart, it needs to be cleaned and organized. That's what "preprocessing" means. The `preprocessing.py` file is like a magical cleaning tool that makes the chart easy to read and understand. It takes away any messy parts, like scribbles or torn pages, and puts everything in the right order.

The `finaid_train.py` file is like the teacher's guidebook. It tells the smart teacher (model) how to look at the cleaned-up chart (preprocessed world data) and figure out which students (countries) need help.

### Conclusion

The preprocessed world data is very useful for training the model using `finaid_train.py`. It's like giving the smart teacher a clean and organized chart to help figure out who needs extra pencils, books, or toys.

With this clean chart, the smart teacher can do a great job of finding the students (countries) that need help and make sure they get what they need to do better.

It's like a big team working together: the cleaning tool, the guidebook, and the smart teacher, all helping to make the classroom (world) a better place!
