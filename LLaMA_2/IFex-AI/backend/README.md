# Image Description Service with LLaMA 2 Chat and CLIP

## Overview

This service uses the LLaMA 2 Chat model for natural language understanding and the CLIP model for image feature extraction.

## File Structure

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python packages required.
- `llama2chat.py`: Contains the LLaMA 2 Chat class for natural language processing.
- `image_describer.py`: Contains the ImageDescriber class for image feature extraction and description generation.
- `main.py`: FastAPI application with an endpoint for image description.
- `test_suite.py`: Unit tests for the application.

## Rationale

- `requirements.txt`: To ensure easy setup and consistent environment.
- `llama2chat.py`: To encapsulate all LLaMA 2 Chat related logic.
- `image_describer.py`: To handle image feature extraction and call LLaMA 2 Chat methods.
- `main.py`: To expose the service as an API.
- `test_suite.py`: To ensure the application works as expected.

## Future Steps

- Implement the logic in the placeholder methods.
- Add more unit tests.
- Integrate with a TypeScript frontend.
